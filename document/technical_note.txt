1. Text/xml parser to parse detector information.

2. Module is a base uint represents detector volume.
   Module has a hiararchy structure, it has a
   unordered_map member which consists of other Modules

   Module has a member which can pass triangle units
   that can be passed to opengl for drawing

   triangle units are generated in Module's subclass, each
   subclass has its own implementation

3. OpenGLView is the unit for rendering the detector 
   assembly. 

4. Cube is a subclass of Module, dedicated for generating
   cube structure

5. Sphere is a subclass of Module, dedicated for generating
   sphere structure

6. Tube is a subclass of Module, etc......

7. GeometryManager is the class for reading geometry defined
   in Text/XML files, it has a Text/XML parser member. GeometryManager
   converts the Text/XML files to Module class objects

8. GeometryView is the entrance Main Window class, it has
   a Module member and an OpenGLView member, its main functionality
   is to config the two members

9. GeometryBuilder is the class, which uses the information from 
   Text/XML parser, and build geometry
